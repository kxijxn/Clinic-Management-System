# Clinic-Management-System

Valley Clinic has opted to create a Management System where patients can make an appointment through the system and request a vaccination appointment as the government has allowed walk-in vaccinations at public clinics so patients can be quickly vaccinated against the coronavirus. Therefore, switching to an Online Management System will minimize the spread of Covid-19 as patients do not need to walk-in and make an appointment with a doctor and minimizing the use pen and paper to record down patient details and making it effective and efficient when doctors are searching patient records as they do not need to search it manually.
